title: Namaste !
---

Glad that you landed here willingly or accidentally. This is where I write down my
heart out. I am a software engineer based in Nepal. If you are about to ask
"why still in Nepal?", I have no good answers for that, I just feel like being
here.
<br/>
<br/>
I have always been fascinated by computers, technology and mathematics. No wonder
why I write geeky stuffs like these, and these.
<br/>
But,
<br/>
Not that boring either. I try to write poems, experiences, love, humor and some
random articles as frequently as possible. So you can stay around and explore
for a while.
<br/>
<br/>
In my free time, I like to take things slow, read books and play chess. I am also
frequently working on small fun side projects.
