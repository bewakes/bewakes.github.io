Poisson distribution is defined as,

$P(x; \lambda) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^x}{x!}$

where,

* $ P(x;λ) $ is the probability that an event occurs x
times in the given interval,
* $ \lambda $ is the expected rate/probability of an event occuring.


In Binomial distribution, probability that one of the two events(p and q) occurs x times out of n trials is,
$P(X = x) = \binom{n}{x} p^x (1 - p)^{n - x}$

where $q=1−p$. Now, if $\lambda$ is the expected number of successes then, $p=\frac{\lambda}{n}$.
