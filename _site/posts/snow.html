<p>Snow,</p>
<p>I’d never seen it so close before,
<br/>
I’ve always wanted to see
<br/>
And this winter was so beautiful,
<br/>
so special, bright and white,
<br/>
it was snowfall and I,
<br/>
felt and touched every flakes
<br/>
that fell upon me.
<br/>
It was so special,
<br/>
for it never snowed here
<br/>
nor will it snow again
<br/>
for THIS winter is never coming back.</p>
<p>But now,
<br/>
the winter has gone,
<br/>
gone far away towards South.
<br/>
And the snow has melted.
<br/>
But I lay here frozen,
<br/>
Frozen than I was ever before,
<br/>
unable to move, shivering with cold
<br/>
the winter has left within me.
<br/>
no more brightness,
<br/>
no more whiteness, that I see now.
<br/></p>
<p>Frozen,
<br/>
but dragging myself to north.
<br/>
North, where there are mountains,
<br/>
at the peak I will stand,
<br/>
from where I will look at this land,
<br/>
where it snowed once.
<br/></p>
<p><br/>
Yes, thats where i will be,
<br/>
SNOW everywhere, bright and white,
<br/>
I will feel every bit of them.
<br/>
and it won’t melt, never!!
<br/>
neither will i freeze again,
<br/>
as there will be warmth
<br/>
for i will be standing,
<br/>
closest to the sun…
<br/></p>
