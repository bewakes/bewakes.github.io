</blockquote>
<p>It was the first year of my engineering studies when I used to stay on my college’s hostel with friends. I joined the college because I wanted to know about computers, my love since I was a little child. Those days were wonderful, but sometimes quite frustrating. Wonderful because I got to learn new concepts and ideas in computer programming. And frustrating because friends used to talk about using ‘SDL’ and graphics, making games and stuffs, when I was just learning about ‘for loops’ and ‘if conditions’. Of course, that was some initial days of first year.</p>
<p>No matter how much fun I used to have with friends and studying, I must say, initial days were quite hard for me. There used to be some technical terms which were so confusing to me. I really could not get the exact meaning of what those meant. One of them was ‘console’. Oh my god!! What in the whole world did that mean??</p>
<p>“I made a game and it runs in console.” some used to say.</p>
<p>“Oh, did you do that in console??” others used to react (Probably they knew what it meant).</p>
<p>And I used to smile, saying to myself “Boy, you need to work really hard, just to be able to converse well with the guys”. Oh Console!!.</p>
<p>Then comes another conversation, which happened in hostel during first year. “What are you doing today?” I asked a friend, who still is among my bests. “I think I’ll code today. Need to code so much.” he replied.</p>
<p>‘Coding’ sounded quite an advanced term. At least for me. I used to wonder what he would be doing when he was “coding”.</p>
<p>This used to go on in my mind, “I don’t ‘code’. I just try to write programs to sort elements in array or something very trivial. I don’t think what I do is called ‘coding’. It’s just sorting elements.”</p>
<p>Even though many things went on in my mind out of my curiosity and the peculiarity of the word ‘coding’, I again used to smile and say, “That’s cool yaar. I think I’ll do the same.”</p>
<p>Four years have passed since those moments. It feels good remembering them and that always puts smile on my face.</p>
<p>And the important thing is that now I think I know what those terms meant then.</p>
