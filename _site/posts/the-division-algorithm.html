        <p>TODO… fix this</p>
<p>Like many things in life, there are many little things in mathematics that we take for granted. We hardly take a moment to look at them, see the beauty that they contain and that they create. The Division Algorithm, I think, is one of those beautiful little pieces in mathematics that deserves to be mentioned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let a</p>
<p>and b be integers with b&gt;0. Then there exist unique integers q and r such that a=bq+r where 0≤r&lt;b</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is so simple and obvious that we never bothered why is it even true.</p>
<h3 id="existence-of-q-and-r">Existence of q and r</h3>
<p>We deal with the uniqueness later on. Let</p>
<p>S=a−bk:k∈Z,a−b≥0</p>
<p>Now if 0∈S then a−bk=0 and thus a=bk⇒r=0.</p>
<p>But if 0∉S, then we first show S is non-empty. If a is positive, a−b.0=a∈S. If a is negative, a−b(2a)=a(1−2b)∈S. We see that S is non-empty either ways.</p>
<p>Let’s recall Well ordering principle which states Every non-empty set of natural numbers contains a minimum element, that is, it is well ordered.</p>
<p>Following the principle, S must have a minimum element, say r. Let, r=a−bq⇒a=bq+r, r≥0.</p>
<p>We now show r&lt;b. Suppose r&gt;b then, r−b=a−bq−b=a−b(q+1) which is of the form a−bk. Thus, r−b∈S and obviously r−b&lt;r.</p>
<p>But, this contradicts with the fact that r is the smallest in S, led by our assumption r&gt;b. Thus, r&lt;b. This proves the existence of r and q such that a=bq+r,0≤r&lt;b.</p>
<h3 id="uniqueness-of-q-and-r">Uniqueness of q and r</h3>
<p>Suppose we have another pair q′
and r′ such that a=bq′+r′,0≤r′&lt;b. Then, bq+r=bq′+r′⇒b(q−q′)=r−r′ Let r&gt;r′ then we have b dividing r−r′ but, 0≤r−r′≤r&lt;b This is possible only if r−r′=0. Thus, r′=r and q′=q.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>The seemingly can-be-taken-for-granted statement involves pretty beautiful and not very straightforward proof. So much to learn from mathematics! I hope this was an interesting read.</p>
<p>NOTE: The proof comes from <a href="https://github.com/twjudson/aata">Abstract Algebra Theory and Applications</a></p>
