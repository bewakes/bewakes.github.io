Neither early nor late
<br/>
To create my very fate
<br/>
In the perfect place and dire time
<br/>
They designed and created what I'm
<br/>
It's high time that I admit
<br/>
I am very glad they did it.

And here I am almost happy always
<br/>
Though I've been through sad days
<br/>
I'm here to see, have already seen some
<br/>
Will see even more in the days to come
<br/>
It's high time that I admit
<br/>
I am very glad they did it.
