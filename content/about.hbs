<h1>About</h1>

<p>Glad to see you here! I am a software engineer based in Nepal and this is where I write down my heart out.
</p>

<p>
I have always been fascinated by computers, technology and mathematics. No wonder
why I write geeky stuffs like <a href="/tags/math.html">these</a>, and <a href="/tags/computer-science.html">these</a>.
</p>

<p>
But,
</p>

<p>
Not that boring either. I try to write <a href="/tags/experience.html">experiences</a>, <a href="/tags/humor.html">humor</a> and some
<a href="/tags/random.html">random articles</a> as frequently as possible. So you can stay around and explore
for a while.
</p>

<p>
In my free time, I like to take things slow, read books and play chess. I am also
frequently working on small fun side projects.
