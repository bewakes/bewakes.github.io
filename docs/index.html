            <b>Namaste!</b>
<br/>

Glad you stumbled here by the forces of universe. This is where I write down my
heart out.
<br/>
<br/>
I am a software engineer based in Nepal. I have always been fascinated by computers, technology and mathematics. No wonder
why I write geeky stuffs like <a href="/tags/math">these</a>, and <a href="/tags/computer-science">these</a>.
<br/>
But,
<br/>
Not that boring either. I try to write <a href="/tags/experience">experiences</a>, <a href="/tags/humor">humor</a> and some
<a href="/tags/random">random articles</a> as frequently as possible. So you can stay around and explore
for a while.
<br/>
<br/>
In my free time, I like to take things slow, read books and play chess. I am also
frequently working on small fun side projects.
<br/>
<br/>
