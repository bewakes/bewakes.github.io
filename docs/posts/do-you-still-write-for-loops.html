        <p>“Bibek, do you sometimes write for loops and if else conditions in your office?”, asks my friend, who has been writing computer programs for a while now.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s all I do.. All the code consists of for loops, if-elses and variable assignments. Additions, subtractions, multiplications..”</p>
<p>With his eyes wide open, he questions me again, “The same for and if statements that I use?”</p>
<p>“And, just like a = 1 or a= b+5 that I wrote in my last program??”, comes another query before I had even answered the previous one.</p>
<p>“OF COURSE!!” I say with a smile.</p>
<p>Then there was a strange look in his face, confused, eyebrows displaced downwards from their usual position. Perhaps he was thinking,</p>
<p>“I thought programmers did awesome things. I might be so wrong about them.”</p>
<p>Or maybe, he still thinks programmers are awesome(good for me!!), but there really was a perplexed look in his face.</p>
<p>Programmers do not do extra ordinary things(at least I don’t do). And you don’t need any extra-terrestrial knowledge to be one. Just use your brain and logical powers that your brain gives you, and you are set to go.</p>
<p>But, I think programmers are God; in a sense that, with their fingers and a computer to bang on, they have their own universe to create, explore, modify and experiment on.</p>
<p>Of course, being a good programmer takes time and experience. But you’ll eventually get there. Just keep amusing yourself and the world with your sweet little ’if’s and ’for’s.</p>
<p>And that’s what I’ve been doing for last 5 years, amusing myself and never getting bored.. :D</p>
<p><strong>Bottomline</strong>: Why be a human while you can be a GOD?? Cheers!!</p>
