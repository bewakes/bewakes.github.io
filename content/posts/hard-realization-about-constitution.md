This week has been the wildest week I've ever encountered as a citizen of Nepal.

It all began with the Gen-Z movement demanding good governance
with an end to long-entrenched corruption that has plagued our country. Within just two days, a series of
heart-wrenching events unfolded at a pace no one could have imagined. Many innocent
teenagers died because of the reckless decision of government and some of the
members of the police. Our *Singha Durbar*, which had stood tall for generations,
was burnt down -- with other national pillars like the parliament and Supreme Court.
Eventually, the Prime Minister had to resign and flee, dissolving the government.


Amid the chaos, one fear haunted me: in this fragile moment, without any one to
lead, what if might fall into the hands of corrupt and the cruel? What if India
does something?
Thankfully, that did not happen. After two tense days of holding our collective breath, we got
the interim Prime Minister which we had asked for. Our first lady Prime Minister.


While anxiously waiting for the decision, I realized something that unsettled
me even more: I knew so little about the constitution of my own country
-- especially about the formation of interim government and what conditions
allow it. And I am sure there's much more that I don't know about. After all,
our constitution is vast and complex.


So I searched online.
But all I found was a dry PDF — difficult to read, harder to follow.

I wished there was a version of our constitution that was clear, simple, and easy to navigate.

Then I thought: *Why only wish when you can build one?*.

After spending some good amount of time and iterations on
the look and feel of the web page, I created the tool that I
wanted. Thanks Claude! It’s a simple but elegant viewer that displays the
constitution’s text verbatim, with features like keyword search and easy
navigation. There’s also a Q&A section with straightforward answers to common
constitutional questions. You can explore it here: [bewakes.com/constitution.html](https://bewakes.com/constitution.html).

Please check it out and share your feedback — it would mean a lot.


Recently, I have come to understand the power of information more deeply than
ever before.
I saw fear spreading like wildfire.
I saw misinformation trying to manipulate people through social media and online platforms.

Information can shape a nation, information can spread faster in this age — but so can misinformation.

It's a long fight but I have
decided to stand stronger: to help spread true, useful information and push back agains falsehoods. What we consume
profoundly shapes where we go -- and where our nation goes.

Building this constitution viewer is my deliberate first step in that mission.
