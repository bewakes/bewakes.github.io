        <p>TODO…. fix this</p>
<p>Two numbers are relatively prime if they have no common divisors except 1. It also means that the numbers have no prime factor in common.</p>
<p>The probability that a number is divisible by 2
is 1/2.
The probability that two numbers are both divisible by 2 is (12).12=122. And thus, probability that neither of the two numbers are divisible by 2 is (1−122)</p>
<p>Similarly, probability that neither of the two numbers are divisible by 3
is (1−132)</p>
<p>Thus the probability that neither of the two numbers are divisible by any of the prime numbers is P(RelativelyPrime)=(1−122).(1−132).(1−152).(1−172)…</p>
<p>However, this is the minimum probability limit for any two numbers being relatively prime.</p>
<p>“Wait, but that’s an infinite product. What am I gonna do with that big product?”</p>
<p>We’ll see.</p>
<p>Let’s intruduce an infinite sum, S=112+122+132+142+152+…
Multiplying both sides by 122</p>
<p>,</p>
<p>122.S=122.112+122.122+122.132+122.142+122.152+…
122.S=122+142+162+182+1102+…</p>
<p>Subtracting the last term from S
, (1−122).S=1+(122−122)+132+(142−142)+152+…</p>
<p>S1=(1−122).S=1+132+152+172+192…</p>
<p>All the multiples of 2 are gone.</p>
<p>Now, multiply S1
by 132. 132.S1=132.1+132.132+132.152+132.172…</p>
<p>Subtracting the last term from S1
. (1−132).S1=1+152+172+(192−192)+… (1−132).S1=1+152+172+1112+…+1232+1252+… (1−132).(1−122).S=1+152+172+1112+…+1232+1252+…</p>
<p>All the remaining multiples of 3 are gone.</p>
<p>If we continue this with all the prime numbers, all the terms on the right are gone except 1. S.(1−122).(1−132)(1−152)(1−172)(1−1112)…=1
So, S=1(1−122).(1−132)(1−152)(1−172)(1−1112)… (1−122)(1−132)(1−152)(1−172)(1−1112)…=1S At the beginning, we defined S=112+122+132+142+152+… This is a very famous sum defined as, ζ(2)=112+122+132+142+152+… The very beautiful symbol ζ is called Reimann Zeta Function named after the mathematician Bernhard Riemann. It is defined for all complex numbers as, ζ(s)=11s+12s+13s+14s+15s+… where s</p>
<p>is a complex number.</p>
<p>It might be surprising, but it is true that ζ(2)=π26</p>
<p>The proof to this fact is <a href="https://bewakes.com/posts/zeta-of-2-is-pi-squared-by-6/">here</a>.</p>
<p>So, going back to our original question, P(RelativelyPrime)=(1−122).(1−132).(1−152).(1−172)…
P(RelativelyPrime)=1ζ(2) P(RelativelyPrime)=1π26 P(RelativelyPrime)=6π2</p>
<p>There we go!! Probability that any two numbers are relatively prime to each other is not a very complicated expression.</p>
