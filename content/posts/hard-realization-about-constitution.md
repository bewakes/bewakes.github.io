This week has been the wildest week I've ever encountered as a citizen of Nepal
in my life. It all started with the Gen-Z movement demanding good governance
with an end to long-prevailing corruption. A couple of very unpleasant and
heart-wrenching events unfolded so quickly within just two days of the
movement. As a result, the Prime Minister had to resign and flee. Many innocent
teenagers died because of the reckless decision of government and some of the
police personnels, our *SinghaDurbar* which had been standing tall since ages
was burnt along with other assets like parliament and Supreme Court.


Amid these happenings was the grave fear that in this very vulnerable situation
of Nepal, without any one to lead, it might fall into the hands of the evil.
Thankfully, that did not happen and after holding breath for two days, we got
the interim Prime Minister which we had asked for.


It was during that period of restlessness while waiting for the decision to be
made regarding the interim Prime Minister when I realized that I do not know
much of the constitution of my country -- at least regarding the formation of
interim government and the conditions for that. And I am sure there would be
more because our constitution is a huge manifesto.


The first thing I did after that was check the web where I could only find the
pdf, which I did not find much readable at all. And I also wanted something
simple and digestible. That's when I decided to create a web version of the
constitution which would have a much better experience. After spending some good
amount of time and iterations on the looks with Claude, I created the
interactive constitution viewer. At the moment it contains the text from
constitution verbatim and a section called Q&A where there are commonly asked
and seemingly useful questions answered in a simple language. There's also a
search option at the bottom where one can search for keywords within the document. You can
find the page [here](https://bewakes.com/constitution.html). Please explore and do provide
your feedback.


I have been lately even more realizing the power of information in shaping a
nation. Information dissemination is easy these days. But that very fact is
true for the flow of wrong information as well. So I have now decided to always stand for good and
consumable information while doing my best to help reducing the wrong
information in the society. What we consume really really has a profound impact
on where we head, where our nation heads. I consider creating the above tool to
view our constitution a deliberate step towards what I stand for.


We will rise.
